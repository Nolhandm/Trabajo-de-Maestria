"This document brings together every indicator currently available on esgdataportal.worldbank.org. It includes both the core ESG Framework indicators and supplementary datasets, such as Country Key Statistics (such as GDP, population growth) and Wealth Accounting data (including Human Capital and the National comprehensive wealth index). The first sheet shows the indicators currently included in the ESG Framework, organized by Environmental, Social and Governance pillars and subdivided into thematic groups (e.g. ""Emissions & pollution""). The second sheet displays the country metadata, showing their income group, geographical region and climate classification. The last sheet includes the complete time-series dataset for every indicator.
