,"World Contraceptive Use 2024 provides a comparable and up-to-date data set of family planning indicators for women of reproductive age (from 15 to 49 years).  The data set pertains to 200 countries or areas of the world for the period from 1950 to 2023 and contains data available as of April 2024.

The data set contains survey-based estimates of the following indicators:  contraceptive prevalence (total, modern and traditional), the unmet need for family planning (total) and the demand for family planning that was satisfied by using modern methods of contraception. Where available, the indicators are disaggregated by marital status and age. Information on contraceptive prevalence by method, and unmet need for spacing and for limiting, is presented for women who were married or in a union at the time the information was collected. Further details on the family planning indicators and data sources are contained in a separate methodology document available on the UN Population Division website (https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/data/world-contraceptive-use).

World Contraceptive Use 2024 was used to generate model-based estimates and projections of family planning indicators for the period from 1970 to 2030, published by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs as Estimates and Projections of Family Planning Indicators 2024.

The current version of this data set was prepared by (in alphabetical order by last name) Yumiko Kamiya, Joseph Molitoris, Rocío Peinador Roldán and Guangyu Zhang. Assistance on programming was provided by Kyaw Kyaw Lay.
